Goals of the Flexible Modular Framework Universities in the UK have spent decades working to create level 7 Courses that best meet the needs of learners and their current or future employers. There are, however, potential learners that traditionally don't engage with such Courses. Mature students that require updated digital skills to progress in their current role; workforces that have significant professional experience but are not yet ready for changes in their work environment; people wishing to change career but unable to afford the time or money for a full level 7 Course that duplicates some of their existing experiential or formal learning; and many others are less likely to enrol. Additionally, the level and nature of the digital skills required by people of a wide range of roles is increasing. It is predicted that within 20 years, 90% of all jobs will require some element of digital skills \\cite{DigitalSkills}. The flexibility of the FMF will provide grater opportunity for people in work to gain digital skills. The FMF is designed to: Rationalise the way universities give credit for prior learning in digital skills. Create a collection of Skills, to be used as Learning Outcome (LOs) in Course design, the meaning which is clearly documented and agreed by the members of the IoC and published for public access. Simplify the process of giving credit for prior learning in digital skills by providing a curated collection of professional development courses and the IoC Skills that anyone successfully completing the course can be expected to have. Create opportunities for universities to add in-demand Skills to their Courses by encouraging the development of easily accessible Modules.

Here, we will discuss the terms Course, Module and Learning Outcome (LO) that are used throughout this document. Each term will be described with the intention of allowing the reader to decide which component in their own institution is the equivalent. For example, some Universities use \"module\" to describe a unit of cogent topics, which would fit into a \"course\" that students sign up for and eventually get an award that matches its name. Another university would claim that this describes, instead, \"courses\" that make up a degree \"programme\" Course In this document, a Course refers to a programme of study in which students are taught, assessed and ultimately awarded a degree. Specifically, any Course that uses the FMF will be a degree that awards a level 7 \"master's\" qualification. The Course will usually be referred to by its title. For example, \"MSc Cyber Security in Equine Studies\", is a (fictitious) Course that might make use of the FMF. Module Within a Course, students are /usually/ taught and assessed in cogent units of material. In this document, each of these units is referred to as a Module. Typically, a Module will: Be assessed in some way Contribute to the Course LOs Teach and assess a single topic or cogent collection of topics relating to the Course Needs thinking about! How many Courses would this definition not fit? Courses that don't divide into Modules or those that have Course level assessment, maybe? Is this a problem? Are those course ones that would be unsuitable for application of the FMF anyway? Learning Outcome A Learning Outcome (LO) is a skill, body of knowledge or awareness required or expected in order for a learner to be considered to have passed a Module and, therefore, a Course. Typically, a Module will have a number of LOs that define the meaning of \"passing\" and so learning and assessment are both a means to achieve the LO. In other words, should a learner be able to demonstrate the LOs, then they have achieved what is required to pass the Module Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) is the recognition, allowed by an academic institution's regulations, of prior learning, and the use of that prior learning to offset Learning Outcome or whole Modules in their current Course. A student with a master's degree in Computer Science, for example, might take a Course in Software Development. If the institution recognises that the programming Module studied and passed by the student in the first Course is equivalent to the programming Module in the new Course, and does not require the student to study or be examined in the programming Module in the new Course, then this is an example of the use of APL. The exact mechanism for applying APL, the allowed level of APL, evidence required and so on, is heavily dependant on the institution. Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning (APEL) Some institutions recognise prior learning beyond academic taught courses, allowing learners with experience from their career to offset work on the course. In this document, we refer to this as Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning (APEL). Professional Development Programme (PDP) Terms with special meanings within the FMF Skills In this document, we use Skill to refer to a capability that a learner can be shown to have. These Skills are the units of capability that the FMF uses to show equivalence between the Learning Outcome of Courses, Modules and Professional Development Programmes. A Skill should be: Unique. The framework will not define multiple names for the same Skill. Atomic. A Skill is a small unit and should not be made up of sub-components. Cogent. Typically a Skill will be around one particular topic, technology or ability. Demonstrable. Every Skill is measurable and usable. The Skills of the FMF should be expressed using Bloom's taxonomy and with consideration of how they are assessed. Skill Providers A Skill Provider is any Course, Module or PDP that has been identified by the IoC FMF as guaranteeing that a learner who successfully completes it will have one or more explicitly identified Skills. When constructing a Course using the FMF, a Course designer should have confidence that any of the Course Learning Outcome expressed as FMFSkills can be achieved by studying and passing a Skill Provider Course or PDP that lists those Learning Outcome. Gateway Assessments A major component of the FMF is the database of Skills and Skill Provider Courses and PDP, which are designed to allow simple and direct recognition of prior learning in FMF Courses. However, not all institutions have regulations that will allow for this recognition without some form of assessment. In such cases, a course may define a \"Gateway Assessment\", which assesses a learner's capability against the FMF Skills. A learner may demonstrate experience through a Course or PDP programme that has the correct Skills, but still be required to pass a Gateway Assessment. Courses using the FMF that require a Gateway Assessment must declare this explicitly so that learners are aware of the requirement before enrolling. The IoC Flexible Modular Framework The Flexible Modular Framework (FMF) has three components: A collection of practical digital skills that has been created in order to provide the smallest set necessary to express digital skills requirements for the widest possible set of Courses and careers. A repository of ways in which learners can learn those skills and demonstrate that learning. This is typically through studying an academic Course or Professional Development Programme, but may also be through experiential learning as part of a work role or independent study. This document, which details how the first two components can be used to offer learners a clear and universally recognised way to offset their prior learning against the requirements of a Level 7 course. As an example, a learner might wish to study MSc. Cyber Security at Coventry Universiry. The Course is constructed of a number of Modules, each of which specify the Learning Outcome (LOs) that must be achieved in order for a learner to complete the Module. The course adheres to the IoC Flexible Modular Framework and so the LOs of these modules are expressed as FMF Skills. If the learner has no previous learning in the specific subject of the Course, then they would take the Course in the traditional manner, seeing very little benefit from the FMF other than having universally recognised Learning Outcome. A learner who /has/ had previous learning experiences from Courses or PDPs that are recognised by the FMF, however, can use that prior learning in place of some of the Modules on the Course. This can mean a quicker route to an award, a lighter study load and perhaps reduced fees, all of which make the opportunity to take the Course more viable for people changing careers, up-skilling or getting back into work. Some Modules will express their LOs in nothing but FMF Skills, and so the replacement of a Module is simple. In cases where a Module requires Learning Outcome that /cannot/ be expressed by FMF Skills (such as instances of highly specialised technologies), or where there are no Skill Providers that can provide some of the Skills or Learning Outcome (such as Modules that require students to demonstrate academic knowledge and skills unlikely to be covered in a PDP), then the institution may use a Gateway Assessment to ensure all Learning Outcome are met. The Gateway Assessment should be a single exercise, in a form appropriate for the topic, that covers all of the Learning Outcome that cannot be met by a Skill Provider and possibly other Learning Outcome for the module. - Curating skills providers and mappings - Link to accreditation Levels of Flexibility The FMF defines three levels of flexibility for a Course. Each of these levels has a set of requirements and expectations. Academic regulations differ between institutions and this may be a deciding factor in selecting a level of flexibility in a new Course. The most flexible Courses allow the greatest recognition of prior formal and experiential learning, but may not be appropriate for all Courses, while basic flexibility is simple to implement under most academic regulations, but limits the potential to take advantage of the catalogue of Skill Providers. For a Course to be recognised as an IoC FMF Course, it must meet the requirements set out in one of the subsections below. Maximum Flexibility A Course that implements maximum flexibility will allow a learner to examine, with or without support, the Learning Outcome, which will be expressed solely in FMF Skills, and be able to identify prior taught or experiential learning that already demonstrates their attainment of some of the required Skills. The prior learning must be an approved FMF Skill Provider, which also ensures that the Learning Outcome are presented as FMF Skills. The Course will not give a limited list of approved Skill Providers, but may place restrictions on the use of prior attainment of Skills to meet the Learning Outcome for any given Module or Modules on the course. For example, a Course that requires any matched Skills to come from a Skill Provider on provided list that is a subset of the FMF Skill Provider database is not considered to be a Course that can be approved under the requirements for maximum flexibility. However, a Course can be considered to meet the requirements for maximum flexibility if it restricts which of its own Modules are appropriate for replacement by prior learning through the FMF, as long as there are no restrictions placed on the /source/ of those replacements. This is particularly useful for maintaining compliance with local institutional regulations and meeting the requirements of accrediting bodies. It is expected that recognition for prior learning will allow a learner to replace only whole Modules of their Course, but this is not a requirement of the FMF. - Whole catalogue of IoC Skills and Skill Providers available - Any matching areas of the Course can be replaced - Can restrict replacement of specific Modules if required - for accreditation, for example Partial Flexibility A Course can implement partial flexibility follows the same requirements as those that implement maximum flexibility, but: The Course may specify a limited set of Skill Providers that can be used to replace Course Modules. The Course may specify a subset of Course Modules that can be replaced by prior learning using FMF Skills equivalence. If the Course requires a limited set of Skill Providers, then it will be defined clearly as a list of records in the IoC FMF Skill Provider database. Any limitation on Modules within the Course that can be replaced by prior learning can be defined by: A list of modules that cannot be replaced by FMF Skill Providers. An explicit list of Modules that can be replaced by FMF Skill Providers A maximum percentage of Modules that can be replaced by FMF Skill Providers Some combination of options 1, 2 and 3. Only the Modules that are allowed to be replaced by learning through an FMF Skill Provider need to have Learning Outcome defined as FMF Skills. Basic Flexibility A Course that implements basic flexibility is one in which there is at least one Module or Learning Outcome that can be met by FMF Skill Providers, and an explicit list of Skill Providers that can be used to meet them. In addition, the Course may allow other recognition of Skill Providers on a case-by-case, learner-by-learner basis using the host institution's regulations for APL or APEL. # - Some key Modules taken at other institutions, explicitly stated in the Course specification # - APL/APEL on a case-by-case basis FMF Skills The list of FMF skills is given in [[Appendix][the Appendix]]. Each Skill has a name, a description, a unique identifier and a description of what a learner with this skill will be capable of. For example, the skill \"Programming: Simple Control Flow\" has a full record that looks like this: Skill Programming: Simple Control Flow ID PROG/2/CTRL Description The use of selection, iteration and function calls to control order of execution Capabilities 1. Create software that uses selection and iteration 2. Use basic \"functional decomposition\" to create and use functions to solve a problem Each of the Skills is unique, atomic and demonstrable. Unique :: Although Skills can be related to each other, no two Skills with different IDs should be considered equivalent. Atomic :: A Skill may have more than one capability associated with it and a learner is not considered to have demonstrated the Skill unless they are able to demonstrate each of them. Demonstrable :: All capabilities are expressed as things that can be observed in a learner's activity and, therefore, assessed. Things to work in - Map each to SFIA skills and levels? - Not all will fit? What do we want that doesn't fit SFIA? - [X] Define schema Requirements for Recognition as a Skill Providers A Skill Provider is any educational unit (Course, Module or PDP, for example) that has been identified by the IoC FMF as guaranteeing that a learner who successfully completes it will have one or more explicitly identified Skills. To be recognised as a Skill Provider, the provider of the unit must submit it for approval by the IoC Skills board. Details of the process are given in the document \" Process for Recognition as a Skill Provider \". The IoC will evaluate each unit for: Alignment with the proposed IoC Skill or Skills. Each unit should lead to demonstration of the capabilities associated with the Skills. Rigour in delivery. All learners should have equal opportunity to excel. Multiple modes of delivery are acceptable as long as they can be shown to lead to equivalent outcomes. Discrimination. Assessment must be shown to discriminate clearly between those learners who gained the specified Skills and those that did not. This may be through a pass/fail outcome in which all learners who pass the unit can demonstrate the Skill; or it could be through some threshold, such that learners might pass the assessment but not achieve a grade high enough to guarantee that they can demonstrate the IoC Skills.
