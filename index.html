                <h1 id="the-flexible-modular-framework">The Flexible Modular Framework</h1>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The Flexible Modular Framework (FMF) is a collection of practical digital
skills; a curated repository of ways in which learners can learn those
skills and demonstrate that learning; and this document, which details
how the skills and repository can be used to create flexible level 7
degree Courses that encourages learners that require recognised
education in modern digital skills by recognising their existing
achievements on other Courses and professional development
activities.</p>
<h2 id="goals-of-the-flexible-modular-framework">Goals of the Flexible Modular Framework</h2>
<p>Universities in the UK have spent decades working to create level 7
 Courses that best meet the needs of learners and their current or
 future employers.  </p>
<p>There are, however, potential learners that traditionally don't engage
 with such Courses.  Mature students that require updated digital
 skills to progress in their current role; workforces that have
 significant professional experience but are not yet ready for changes
 in their work environment; people wishing to change career but unable
 to afford the time or money for a full level 7 Course that
 duplicates some of their existing experiential or formal learning; and
 many others are less likely to enrol.</p>
<p>Additionally, the level and nature of the digital skills required by
 people of a wide range of roles is increasing. It is predicted that
 within 20 years, 90% of all jobs will require some element of digital
 skills \cite{DigitalSkills}. The flexibility of the FMF will
 provide grater opportunity for people in work to gain digital skills.</p>
<p>The FMF is designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rationalise the way universities give credit for prior learning in
  digital skills.</li>
<li>Create a collection of Skills, to be used as Learning Outcome
  (LOs) in Course design, the meaning which is clearly
  documented and agreed by the members of the IoC and published for
  public access.</li>
<li>Simplify the process of giving credit for prior learning in digital
  skills by providing a curated collection of professional
  development courses and the IoC Skills that anyone successfully
  completing the course can be expected to have.</li>
<li>Create opportunities for universities to add in-demand Skills
  to their Courses by encouraging the development of easily
  accessible Modules.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="names-and-terminology">Names and Terminology</h1>
<h2 id="terms-that-differ-between-institutions">Terms that Differ Between Institutions</h2>
<p>Different institutions use different terms for the units of teaching
and learning in which their students are enrolled. Here, we will
discuss the terms Course, Module and Learning Outcome
(LO) that are used throughout this document.  Each term will be
described with the intention of allowing the reader to decide which
component in their own institution is the equivalent.  For example,
some Universities use "module" to describe a unit of cogent topics,
which would fit into a "course" that students sign up for and
eventually get an award that matches its name.  Another university
would claim that this describes, instead, "courses" that make up a
degree "programme"</p>
<h3 id="course">Course</h3>
<p>In this document, a Course refers to a programme of study in
which students are taught, assessed and ultimately awarded a degree.
Specifically, any Course that uses the FMF will be a
degree that awards a level 7 "master's" qualification. </p>
<p>The Course will usually be referred to by its title. For
example, "MSc Cyber Security in Equine Studies", is a (fictitious)
Course that might make use of the FMF.</p>
<h3 id="module">Module</h3>
<p>Within a Course, students are /usually/ taught and assessed in
cogent units of material.  In this document, each of these units is
referred to as a Module. </p>
<p>Typically, a Module will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be assessed in some way</li>
<li>Contribute to the Course LOs</li>
<li>Teach and assess a single topic or cogent collection of topics
   relating to the Course</li>
</ul>
<div class="todo"> Needs thinking about!

How many Courses would this definition not fit? Courses
that don't divide into Modules or those that have Course
level assessment, maybe? Is this a problem?  Are those course ones
that would be unsuitable for application of the FMF anyway?
</div>

<h3 id="learning-outcome">Learning Outcome</h3>
<p>A Learning Outcome (LO) is a skill, body of knowledge or awareness
required or expected in order for a learner to be considered to have
passed a Module and, therefore, a Course.</p>
<p>Typically, a Module will have a number of LOs that define
the meaning of "passing" and so learning and assessment are both a
means to achieve the LO. In other words, should a learner be
able to demonstrate the LOs, then they have achieved what is
required to pass the Module</p>
<h3 id="accreditation-of-prior-learning-apl">Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL)</h3>
<p>Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL) is the recognition, allowed by an academic
institution's regulations, of prior learning, and the use of that
prior learning to offset Learning Outcome or whole Modules in
their current Course.</p>
<p>A student with a master's degree in Computer Science, for example,
might take a Course in Software Development. If the institution
recognises that the programming Module studied and passed by the
student in the first Course is equivalent to the programming
Module in the new Course, and does not require the student
to study or be examined in the programming Module in the new
Course, then this is an example of the use of APL.</p>
<p>The exact mechanism for applying APL, the allowed level of
APL, evidence required and so on, is heavily dependant on the
institution.</p>
<h3 id="accreditation-of-prior-experiential-learning-apel">Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning (APEL)</h3>
<p>Some institutions recognise prior learning beyond academic taught
courses, allowing learners with experience from their career to offset
work on the course.  In this document, we refer to this as
Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning (APEL).</p>
<h3 id="professional-development-programme-pdp">Professional Development Programme (PDP)</h3>
<h2 id="terms-with-special-meanings-within-the-fmf">Terms with special meanings within the FMF</h2>
<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
<p>In this document, we use Skill to refer to a capability that a
learner can be shown to have.  These Skills are the units of
capability that the FMF uses to show equivalence between the Learning Outcome of
Courses, Modules and Professional Development Programmes.</p>
<p>A Skill should be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unique. The framework will not define multiple names for the same Skill.</li>
<li>Atomic. A Skill is a small unit and should not be made up of sub-components.</li>
<li>Cogent. Typically a Skill will be around one particular topic, technology or ability.</li>
<li>Demonstrable. Every Skill is measurable and usable.  The
   Skills of the FMF should be expressed using Bloom's
   taxonomy and with consideration of how they are assessed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="skill-providers">Skill Providers</h3>
<p>A Skill Provider is any Course, Module or
PDP that has been identified by the IoC FMF as
guaranteeing that a learner who successfully completes it will have
one or more explicitly identified Skills.</p>
<p>When constructing a Course using the FMF, a Course
designer should have confidence that any of the Course
Learning Outcome expressed as FMFSkills can be achieved by
studying and passing a Skill Provider Course or PDP
that lists those Learning Outcome.</p>
<h3 id="gateway-assessments">Gateway Assessments</h3>
<p>A major component of the FMF is the database of Skills and
Skill Provider Courses and PDP, which are designed
to allow simple and direct recognition of prior learning in FMF
Courses.  </p>
<p>However, not all institutions have regulations that will allow for
this recognition without some form of assessment. In such cases, a
course may define a "Gateway Assessment", which assesses a learner's
capability against the FMF Skills.  A learner may
demonstrate experience through a Course or PDP programme
that has the correct Skills, but still be required to pass a
Gateway Assessment.  Courses using the FMF that require a
Gateway Assessment must declare this explicitly so that learners are
aware of the requirement before enrolling. </p>
<h1 id="the-ioc-flexible-modular-framework">The IoC Flexible Modular Framework</h1>
<p>The Flexible Modular Framework (FMF) has three components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A collection of practical digital skills that has been created in
    order to provide the smallest set necessary to express digital
    skills requirements for the widest possible set of Courses
    and careers.</li>
<li>A repository of ways in which learners can learn those skills and
    demonstrate that learning. This is typically through studying an
    academic Course or Professional Development Programme, but may also be through
    experiential learning as part of a work role or independent study.</li>
<li>This document, which details how the first two components can be
    used to offer learners a clear and universally recognised way to
    offset their prior learning against the requirements of a Level 7
    course.  </li>
</ol>
<p>As an example, a learner might wish to study
MSc. Cyber Security at Coventry Universiry.
The Course is constructed of a number of Modules, each of
which specify the Learning Outcome (LOs) that must be achieved in
order for a learner to complete the Module. The course adheres
to the IoC Flexible Modular Framework and so the LOs of these modules are
expressed as FMF Skills.</p>
<p>If the learner has no previous learning in the specific subject of the
Course, then they would take the Course in the traditional
manner, seeing very little benefit from the FMF other than
having universally recognised Learning Outcome.</p>
<p>A learner who /has/ had previous learning experiences from
Courses or PDPs that are recognised by the FMF,
however, can use that prior learning in place of some of the
Modules on the Course.  This can mean a quicker route to
an award, a lighter study load and perhaps reduced fees, all of which
make the opportunity to take the Course more viable for people
changing careers, up-skilling or getting back into work.</p>
<p>Some Modules will express their LOs in nothing but
FMF Skills, and so the replacement of a Module is
simple.  In cases where a Module requires Learning Outcome that
/cannot/ be expressed by FMF Skills (such as instances of
highly specialised technologies), or where there are no
Skill Providers that can provide some of the Skills or
Learning Outcome (such as Modules that require students to
demonstrate academic knowledge and skills unlikely to be covered in a
PDP), then the institution may use a Gateway Assessment to ensure
all Learning Outcome are met.  The Gateway Assessment should be a single
exercise, in a form appropriate for the topic, that covers all of the
Learning Outcome that cannot be met by a Skill Provider and
possibly other Learning Outcome for the module.</p>
<div class="todo">

  - Link to accreditation
</div>

<h1 id="levels-of-flexibility">Levels of  Flexibility</h1>
<p>The FMF defines three levels of flexibility for a Course.
Each of these levels has a set of requirements and
expectations. Academic regulations differ between institutions and
this may be a deciding factor in selecting a level of flexibility in a
new Course.  The most flexible Courses allow the greatest
recognition of prior formal and experiential learning, but may not be
appropriate for all Courses, while basic flexibility is simple
to implement under most academic regulations, but limits the potential
to take advantage of the catalogue of Skill Providers.</p>
<p>For a Course to be recognised as an IoC FMF Course,
it must meet the requirements set out in one of the subsections below.</p>
<h2 id="maximum-flexibility">Maximum Flexibility</h2>
<p>A Course that implements maximum flexibility will allow a
learner to examine, with or without support, the Learning Outcome, which
will be expressed solely in FMF Skills, and be able to
identify prior taught or experiential learning that already
demonstrates their attainment of some of the required Skills.</p>
<p>The prior learning must be an approved FMF Skill Provider,
which also ensures that the Learning Outcome are presented as FMF
Skills.</p>
<p>The Course will not give a limited list of approved
Skill Providers, but may place restrictions on the use of prior
attainment of Skills to meet the Learning Outcome for any given
Module or Modules on the course.  For example, a
Course that requires any matched Skills to come from a
Skill Provider on provided list that is a subset of the
FMF Skill Provider database is not considered to be a
Course that can be approved under the requirements for maximum
flexibility.  However, a Course can be considered to meet the
requirements for maximum flexibility if it restricts which of its own
Modules are appropriate for replacement by prior learning
through the FMF, as long as there are no restrictions placed on
the /source/ of those replacements. This is particularly useful for
maintaining compliance with local institutional regulations and
meeting the requirements of accrediting bodies.</p>
<p>It is expected that recognition for prior learning will allow a
learner to replace only whole Modules of their Course, but
this is not a requirement of the FMF.</p>
<div class="todo">
<ul>
<li>  - Whole catalogue of IoC Skills and Skill Providers available
<li>  - Any matching areas of the Course can be replaced
<li>  - Can restrict replacement of specific Modules if required -
    for accreditation, for example
    </ul>
 </div>

<h2 id="partial-flexibility">Partial Flexibility</h2>
<p>A Course can implement partial flexibility follows the same
requirements as those that implement maximum flexibility, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Course may specify a limited set of Skill Providers
   that can be used to replace Course Modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Course may specify a subset of Course Modules
   that can be replaced by prior learning using FMF Skills
   equivalence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Course requires a limited set of Skill Providers,
then it will be defined clearly as a list of records in the IoC
FMF Skill Provider database.</p>
<p>Any limitation on Modules within the Course that can be replaced
by prior learning can be defined by:</p>
<ol>
<li>A list of modules that <em>cannot</em> be replaced by FMF
    Skill Providers.</li>
<li>An explicit list of Modules that <em>can</em> be replaced by
    FMF Skill Providers</li>
<li>A maximum <em>percentage</em> of Modules that can be replaced by
    FMF Skill Providers</li>
<li>Some combination of options 1, 2 and 3.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only the Modules that are allowed to be replaced by learning
through an FMF Skill Provider need to have Learning Outcome
defined as FMF Skills.</p>
<p><!-- - Full or subset of Skill Providers -->
  <!-- - Subset of Course (stated explicitly or as a percentage) can be replaced with learning from other Skill Providers --></p>
<h2 id="basic-flexibility">Basic Flexibility</h2>
<p>A Course that implements basic flexibility is one in which there
is at least one Module or Learning Outcome that can be met by
FMF Skill Providers, and an explicit list of
Skill Providers that can be used to meet them.</p>
<p>In addition, the Course may allow other recognition of
Skill Providers on a case-by-case, learner-by-learner basis
using the host institution's regulations for APL or APEL.</p>
<div class="todo">
 # - Some key Modules taken at other institutions, explicitly stated in the Course specification
 # - APL/APEL on a case-by-case basis
</div>

<h1 id="fmf-skills">FMF Skills</h1>
<p>The list of FMF skills is given in [[Appendix][the Appendix]]. Each
Skill has a name, a description, a unique identifier and a
description of what a learner with this skill will be capable of.</p>
<p>For example, the skill "Programming: Simple Control Flow" has a full
record that looks like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>Skill</em></td>
<td>Programming: Simple Control Flow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>ID</em></td>
<td>PROG/2/CTRL</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Description</em></td>
<td>The use of selection, iteration and function calls to control order of  execution</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Capabilities</em></td>
<td>1. Create software that uses selection and iteration</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>2. Use basic "functional decomposition" to create and use functions to solve a problem</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each of the Skills is unique, atomic and demonstrable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique :: Although Skills can be related to each other, no
             two Skills with different IDs should be considered
             equivalent.</li>
<li>Atomic :: A Skill may have more than one capability
             associated with it and a learner is not considered to
             have demonstrated the Skill unless they are able to
             demonstrate each of them.</li>
<li>Demonstrable :: All capabilities are expressed as things that can
                   be observed in a learner's activity and, therefore,
                   assessed.</li>

<p>A Skill Provider is any educational unit (Course,

the IoC FMF as guaranteeing that a learner who successfully
completes it will have one or more explicitly identified Skills.</p>
<p>To be recognised as a Skill Provider, the provider of the unit
must submit it for approval by the IoC Skills board. Details of
the process are given in the document
"<a href="recog_skill_prov/">Process for Recognition as a Skill Provider</a>".</p>
<p>The IoC will evaluate each unit for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alignment with the proposed IoC Skill or Skills. Each
    unit should lead to demonstration of the capabilities associated
    with the Skills.</li>
<li>Rigour in delivery. All learners should have equal opportunity to
    excel. Multiple modes of delivery are acceptable as long as they
    can be shown to lead to equivalent outcomes.</li>
<li>Discrimination. Assessment must be shown to discriminate clearly
    between those learners who gained the specified Skills and
    those that did not. This may be through a pass/fail outcome in
    which all learners who pass the unit can demonstrate the
    Skill; or it could be through some threshold, such that
    learners might pass the assessment but not achieve a grade high
    enough to guarantee that they can demonstrate the IoC Skills.</li>

<li>Decide level of flexibility</li>
<li>Create lists of restricted or allowed replacements, if appropriate</li>
<li>Review by IoC panel (4 times a year, IoC members from Academia

<li>What about course changes?<ul>
<li>Keep light touch approach - pair of panel members check over

<li>Courses that are not "approved" cannot claim to adhere to the

<h1 id="version-information">Version Information</h1>
<p>This is version [0.1.draft] of the Flexible Modular Framework
specification.</p>
<h2 id="version-numbering">Version Numbering</h2>
<p>This is a version-controlled document.  The latest version can be
  accessed at NOT IMPLEMENTED.  Courses created using the
  Flexible Modular Framework should clearly state the version of this document
  that was used to prevent confusion.  </p>
<p>It is recommended that courses update to the latest version of this
  document as soon as possible. The IoC will make every effort to keep
  the time between versions as long as possible.</p>
<p>Versions identifiers are of the format [major.minor.postfix]. Major
  and minor are integers such that a higher relative major version
  always indicates a newer version and a higher relative minor version
  between documents with equal major versions indicates a newer
  version.  Versions with equal major number will generally be
  similar, with larger minor version indicating clarifications and
  fixing of errors.  Changes to the major version number indicate more
  fundamental changes to the intention of parts of the document or the
  Flexible Modular Framework as a whole.</p>
<p>The postfix element will always be one of <em>final</em> or <em>draft</em>. Any
  version with a postfix of <em>draft</em> is for consultation and
  information only. Only when a version is released with a postfix
  element of <em>final</em> should it be considered for use.</p>
