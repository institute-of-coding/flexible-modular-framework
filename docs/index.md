The Flexible Modular Framework
==============================

# Introduction
The {{ fmf.fmf_long }} ({{ fmf.fmf }}) is a collection of practical digital
skills; a curated repository of ways in which learners can learn those
skills and demonstrate that learning; and this document, which details
how the skills and repository can be used to create flexible level 7
degree {{ fmf.courses }} that encourages learners that require recognised
education in modern digital skills by recognising their existing
achievements on other {{ fmf.courses }} and professional development
activities.

## Goals of the {{ fmf.fmf_long }}

 Universities in the UK have spent decades working to create level 7
 {{ fmf.courses }} that best meet the needs of learners and their current or
 future employers.  

 There are, however, potential learners that traditionally don't engage
 with such {{ fmf.courses }}.  Mature students that require updated digital
 skills to progress in their current role; workforces that have
 significant professional experience but are not yet ready for changes
 in their work environment; people wishing to change career but unable
 to afford the time or money for a full level 7 {{ fmf.course }} that
 duplicates some of their existing experiential or formal learning; and
 many others are less likely to enrol.

 Additionally, the level and nature of the digital skills required by
 people of a wide range of roles is increasing. It is predicted that
 within 20 years, 90% of all jobs will require some element of digital
 skills \cite{DigitalSkills}. The flexibility of the {{ fmf.fmf }} will
 provide grater opportunity for people in work to gain digital skills.




 The {{ fmf.fmf }} is designed to:

* Rationalise the way universities give credit for prior learning in
  digital skills.
* Create a collection of {{ fmf.skills }}, to be used as {{ fmf.los_long }}
  ({{ fmf.los }}) in {{ fmf.course }} design, the meaning which is clearly
  documented and agreed by the members of the IoC and published for
  public access.
* Simplify the process of giving credit for prior learning in digital
  skills by providing a curated collection of professional
  development courses and the IoC {{ fmf.skills }} that anyone successfully
  completing the course can be expected to have.
* Create opportunities for universities to add in-demand {{ fmf.skills }}
  to their {{ fmf.courses }} by encouraging the development of easily
  accessible {{ fmf.modules }}.

# Names and Terminology

## Terms that Differ Between Institutions

Different institutions use different terms for the units of teaching
and learning in which their students are enrolled. Here, we will
discuss the terms {{ fmf.course }}, {{ fmf.module }} and {{ fmf.lo_long }}
({{ fmf.lo }}) that are used throughout this document.  Each term will be
described with the intention of allowing the reader to decide which
component in their own institution is the equivalent.  For example,
some Universities use "module" to describe a unit of cogent topics,
which would fit into a "course" that students sign up for and
eventually get an award that matches its name.  Another university
would claim that this describes, instead, "courses" that make up a
degree "programme"

### {{ fmf.course }}

In this document, a {{ fmf.course }} refers to a programme of study in
which students are taught, assessed and ultimately awarded a degree.
Specifically, any {{ fmf.course }} that uses the {{ fmf.fmf }} will be a
degree that awards a level 7 "master's" qualification. 

The {{ fmf.course }} will usually be referred to by its title. For
example, "MSc Cyber Security in Equine Studies", is a (fictitious)
{{ fmf.course }} that might make use of the {{ fmf.fmf }}.

### {{ fmf.module }}

Within a {{ fmf.course }}, students are /usually/ taught and assessed in
cogent units of material.  In this document, each of these units is
referred to as a {{ fmf.module }}. 

Typically, a {{ fmf.module }} will:

* Be assessed in some way
* Contribute to the {{ fmf.course }} {{ fmf.los }}
* Teach and assess a single topic or cogent collection of topics
   relating to the {{ fmf.course }}



<div class="todo"> Needs thinking about!

How many {{ fmf.course }}s would this definition not fit? {{ fmf.courses }}
that don't divide into {{ fmf.modules }} or those that have {{ fmf.course }}
level assessment, maybe? Is this a problem?  Are those course ones
that would be unsuitable for application of the {{ fmf.fmf }} anyway?
</div>

### {{ fmf.lo_long }}

A {{ fmf.lo_long }} ({{ fmf.lo }}) is a skill, body of knowledge or awareness
required or expected in order for a learner to be considered to have
passed a {{ fmf.module }} and, therefore, a {{ fmf.course }}.

Typically, a {{ fmf.module }} will have a number of {{ fmf.los }} that define
the meaning of "passing" and so learning and assessment are both a
means to achieve the {{ fmf.lo }}. In other words, should a learner be
able to demonstrate the {{ fmf.los }}, then they have achieved what is
required to pass the {{ fmf.module }}

### {{ fmf.apl_long }} ({{ fmf.apl }})

{{ fmf.apl_long }} ({{ fmf.apl }}) is the recognition, allowed by an academic
institution's regulations, of prior learning, and the use of that
prior learning to offset {{ fmf.los_long }} or whole {{ fmf.modules }} in
their current {{ fmf.course }}.

A student with a master's degree in Computer Science, for example,
might take a {{ fmf.course }} in Software Development. If the institution
recognises that the programming {{ fmf.module }} studied and passed by the
student in the first {{ fmf.course }} is equivalent to the programming
{{ fmf.module }} in the new {{ fmf.course }}, and does not require the student
to study or be examined in the programming {{ fmf.module }} in the new
{{ fmf.course }}, then this is an example of the use of {{ fmf.apl }}.

The exact mechanism for applying {{ fmf.apl }}, the allowed level of
{{ fmf.apl }}, evidence required and so on, is heavily dependant on the
institution.

### {{ fmf.apel_long }} ({{ fmf.apel }})

Some institutions recognise prior learning beyond academic taught
courses, allowing learners with experience from their career to offset
work on the course.  In this document, we refer to this as
{{ fmf.apel_long }} ({{ fmf.apel }}).


### {{ fmf.pdp_long }} ({{ fmf.pdp }})
## Terms with special meanings within the {{ fmf.fmf }}
### {{ fmf.skills }}

In this document, we use {{ fmf.skill }} to refer to a capability that a
learner can be shown to have.  These {{ fmf.skills }} are the units of
capability that the {{ fmf.fmf }} uses to show equivalence between the {{ fmf.los_long }} of
{{ fmf.courses }}, {{ fmf.modules }} and {{ fmf.pdps_long }}.

A {{ fmf.skill }} should be:

1. Unique. The framework will not define multiple names for the same {{ fmf.skill }}.
2. Atomic. A {{ fmf.skill }} is a small unit and should not be made up of sub-components.
3. Cogent. Typically a {{ fmf.skill }} will be around one particular topic, technology or ability.
4. Demonstrable. Every {{ fmf.skill }} is measurable and usable.  The
   {{ fmf.skills }} of the {{ fmf.fmf }} should be expressed using Bloom's
   taxonomy and with consideration of how they are assessed.


### {{ fmf.skill_providers }}

A {{ fmf.skill_provider }} is any {{ fmf.course }}, {{ fmf.module }} or
{{ fmf.pdp }} that has been identified by the IoC {{ fmf.fmf }} as
guaranteeing that a learner who successfully completes it will have
one or more explicitly identified {{ fmf.skills }}.

When constructing a {{ fmf.course }} using the {{ fmf.fmf }}, a {{ fmf.course }}
designer should have confidence that any of the {{ fmf.course }}
{{ fmf.los_long }} expressed as {{ fmf.fmf }}{{ fmf.skills }} can be achieved by
studying and passing a {{ fmf.skill_provider }} {{ fmf.course }} or {{ fmf.pdp }}
that lists those {{ fmf.los_long }}.




### {{ fmf.gateway_asss }}

A major component of the {{ fmf.fmf }} is the database of {{ fmf.skills }} and
{{ fmf.skill_provider }} {{ fmf.courses }} and {{ fmf.pdp }}, which are designed
to allow simple and direct recognition of prior learning in {{ fmf.fmf }}
{{ fmf.courses }}.  

However, not all institutions have regulations that will allow for
this recognition without some form of assessment. In such cases, a
course may define a "{{ fmf.gateway_ass }}", which assesses a learner's
capability against the {{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skills }}.  A learner may
demonstrate experience through a {{ fmf.course }} or {{ fmf.pdp }} programme
that has the correct {{ fmf.skills }}, but still be required to pass a
{{ fmf.gateway_ass }}.  {{ fmf.courses }} using the {{ fmf.fmf }} that require a
{{ fmf.gateway_ass }} must declare this explicitly so that learners are
aware of the requirement before enrolling. 




# The IoC {{ fmf.fmf_long }}
The {{ fmf.fmf_long }} ({{ fmf.fmf }}) has three components:

 1. A collection of practical digital skills that has been created in
    order to provide the smallest set necessary to express digital
    skills requirements for the widest possible set of {{ fmf.courses }}
    and careers.
 2. A repository of ways in which learners can learn those skills and
    demonstrate that learning. This is typically through studying an
    academic {{ fmf.course }} or {{ fmf.pdp_long }}, but may also be through
    experiential learning as part of a work role or independent study.
 3. This document, which details how the first two components can be
    used to offer learners a clear and universally recognised way to
    offset their prior learning against the requirements of a Level 7
    course.  

As an example, a learner might wish to study
{{ fmf.approved_course_example }} at {{ fmf.approved_course_institution }}.
The {{ fmf.course }} is constructed of a number of {{ fmf.modules }}, each of
which specify the {{ fmf.los_long }} ({{ fmf.los }}) that must be achieved in
order for a learner to complete the {{ fmf.module }}. The course adheres
to the IoC {{ fmf.fmf_long }} and so the {{ fmf.los }} of these modules are
expressed as {{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skills }}.

If the learner has no previous learning in the specific subject of the
{{ fmf.course }}, then they would take the {{ fmf.course }} in the traditional
manner, seeing very little benefit from the {{ fmf.fmf }} other than
having universally recognised {{ fmf.los_long }}.

A learner who /has/ had previous learning experiences from
{{ fmf.courses }} or {{ fmf.pdp }}s that are recognised by the {{ fmf.fmf }},
however, can use that prior learning in place of some of the
{{ fmf.modules }} on the {{ fmf.course }}.  This can mean a quicker route to
an award, a lighter study load and perhaps reduced fees, all of which
make the opportunity to take the {{ fmf.course }} more viable for people
changing careers, up-skilling or getting back into work.

Some {{ fmf.modules }} will express their {{ fmf.los }} in nothing but
{{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skills }}, and so the replacement of a {{ fmf.module }} is
simple.  In cases where a {{ fmf.module }} requires {{ fmf.los_long }} that
/cannot/ be expressed by {{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skills }} (such as instances of
highly specialised technologies), or where there are no
{{ fmf.skill_providers }} that can provide some of the {{ fmf.skills }} or
{{ fmf.los_long }} (such as {{ fmf.modules }} that require students to
demonstrate academic knowledge and skills unlikely to be covered in a
{{ fmf.pdp }}), then the institution may use a {{ fmf.gateway_ass }} to ensure
all {{ fmf.los_long }} are met.  The {{ fmf.gateway_ass }} should be a single
exercise, in a form appropriate for the topic, that covers all of the
{{ fmf.los_long }} that cannot be met by a {{ fmf.skill_provider }} and
possibly other {{ fmf.los_long }} for the module.

  - Link to accreditation
</div>

# Levels of  Flexibility
The {{ fmf.fmf }} defines three levels of flexibility for a {{ fmf.course }}.
Each of these levels has a set of requirements and
expectations. Academic regulations differ between institutions and
this may be a deciding factor in selecting a level of flexibility in a
new {{ fmf.course }}.  The most flexible {{ fmf.courses }} allow the greatest
recognition of prior formal and experiential learning, but may not be
appropriate for all {{ fmf.courses }}, while basic flexibility is simple
to implement under most academic regulations, but limits the potential
to take advantage of the catalogue of {{ fmf.skill_providers }}.

For a {{ fmf.course }} to be recognised as an IoC {{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.course }},
it must meet the requirements set out in one of the subsections below.



## Maximum Flexibility
A {{ fmf.course }} that implements maximum flexibility will allow a
learner to examine, with or without support, the {{ fmf.los_long }}, which
will be expressed solely in {{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skills }}, and be able to
identify prior taught or experiential learning that already
demonstrates their attainment of some of the required {{ fmf.skills }}.

The prior learning must be an approved {{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skill_provider }},
which also ensures that the {{ fmf.los_long }} are presented as {{ fmf.fmf }}
{{ fmf.skills }}.

The {{ fmf.course }} will not give a limited list of approved
{{ fmf.skill_providers }}, but may place restrictions on the use of prior
attainment of {{ fmf.skills }} to meet the {{ fmf.los_long }} for any given
{{ fmf.module }} or {{ fmf.modules }} on the course.  For example, a
{{ fmf.course }} that requires any matched {{ fmf.skills }} to come from a
{{ fmf.skill_provider }} on provided list that is a subset of the
{{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skill_provider }} database is not considered to be a
{{ fmf.course }} that can be approved under the requirements for maximum
flexibility.  However, a {{ fmf.course }} can be considered to meet the
requirements for maximum flexibility if it restricts which of its own
{{ fmf.modules }} are appropriate for replacement by prior learning
through the {{ fmf.fmf }}, as long as there are no restrictions placed on
the /source/ of those replacements. This is particularly useful for
maintaining compliance with local institutional regulations and
meeting the requirements of accrediting bodies.

It is expected that recognition for prior learning will allow a
learner to replace only whole {{ fmf.modules }} of their {{ fmf.course }}, but
this is not a requirement of the {{ fmf.fmf }}.


<div class="todo">
<ul>
<li>  - Whole catalogue of IoC {{ fmf.skills }} and {{ fmf.skill_providers }} available
<li>  - Any matching areas of the {{ fmf.course }} can be replaced
<li>  - Can restrict replacement of specific {{ fmf.modules }} if required -
    for accreditation, for example
	</ul>
 </div>
## Partial Flexibility

A {{ fmf.course }} can implement partial flexibility follows the same
requirements as those that implement maximum flexibility, but:

 - The {{ fmf.course }} may specify a limited set of {{ fmf.skill_providers }}
   that can be used to replace {{ fmf.course }} {{ fmf.modules }}.

 - The {{ fmf.course }} may specify a subset of {{ fmf.course }} {{ fmf.modules }}
   that can be replaced by prior learning using {{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skills }}
   equivalence.

If the {{ fmf.course }} requires a limited set of {{ fmf.skill_providers }},
then it will be defined clearly as a list of records in the IoC
{{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skill_provider }} database.

Any limitation on {{ fmf.modules }} within the {{ fmf.course }} that can be replaced
by prior learning can be defined by:

1. A list of modules that *cannot* be replaced by {{ fmf.fmf }}
    {{ fmf.skill_providers }}.
 2. An explicit list of {{ fmf.modules }} that *can* be replaced by
    {{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skill_providers }}
 3. A maximum *percentage* of {{ fmf.modules }} that can be replaced by
    {{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skill_providers }}
 4. Some combination of options 1, 2 and 3.


Only the {{ fmf.modules }} that are allowed to be replaced by learning
through an {{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skill_provider }} need to have {{ fmf.los_long }}
defined as {{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skills }}.

  <!-- - Full or subset of {{ fmf.skill_providers }} -->
  <!-- - Subset of {{ fmf.course }} (stated explicitly or as a percentage) can be replaced with learning from other {{ fmf.skill_providers }} -->
## Basic Flexibility

A {{ fmf.course }} that implements basic flexibility is one in which there
is at least one {{ fmf.module }} or {{ fmf.lo_long }} that can be met by
{{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skill_providers }}, and an explicit list of
{{ fmf.skill_providers }} that can be used to meet them.



In addition, the {{ fmf.course }} may allow other recognition of
{{ fmf.skill_providers }} on a case-by-case, learner-by-learner basis
using the host institution's regulations for {{ fmf.apl }} or {{ fmf.apel }}.


<div class="todo">
 # - Some key {{ fmf.modules }} taken at other institutions, explicitly stated in the {{ fmf.course }} specification
 # - {{ fmf.apl }}/{{ fmf.apel }} on a case-by-case basis
</div>

# {{ fmf.fmf }} {{ fmf.skills }} 

The list of {{ fmf.fmf }} skills is given in [[Appendix][the Appendix]]. Each
{{ fmf.skill }} has a name, a description, a unique identifier and a
description of what a learner with this skill will be capable of.

For example, the skill "Programming: Simple Control Flow" has a full
record that looks like this:

|               |                                                                                        |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Skill*       | Programming: Simple Control Flow                                                       |
| *ID*          | PROG/2/CTRL                                                                            |
| *Description* | The use of selection, iteration and function calls to control order of  execution      |
| *Capabilities* | 1. Create software that uses selection and iteration                                   |
|               | 2. Use basic "functional decomposition" to create and use functions to solve a problem |




Each of the {{ fmf.skills }} is unique, atomic and demonstrable.

 - Unique :: Although {{ fmf.skills }} can be related to each other, no
             two {{ fmf.skills }} with different IDs should be considered
             equivalent.
 - Atomic :: A {{ fmf.skill }} may have more than one capability
             associated with it and a learner is not considered to
             have demonstrated the {{ fmf.skill }} unless they are able to
             demonstrate each of them.
 - Demonstrable :: All capabilities are expressed as things that can
                   be observed in a learner's activity and, therefore,
                   assessed.

<div class="todo">
Requirements for Recognition as a {{ fmf.skill_providers }} 
</div>

A {{ fmf.skill_provider }} is any educational unit ({{ fmf.course }},
{{ fmf.module }} or {{ fmf.pdp }}, for example) that has been identified by
the IoC {{ fmf.fmf }} as guaranteeing that a learner who successfully
completes it will have one or more explicitly identified {{ fmf.skills }}.

To be recognised as a {{ fmf.skill_provider }}, the provider of the unit
must submit it for approval by the IoC {{ fmf.skills }} board. Details of
the process are given in the document
"[Process for Recognition as a Skill Provider](./recog_skill_prov.md)".

The IoC will evaluate each unit for:

 1. Alignment with the proposed IoC {{ fmf.skill }} or {{ fmf.skills }}. Each
    unit should lead to demonstration of the capabilities associated
    with the {{ fmf.skills }}.
 2. Rigour in delivery. All learners should have equal opportunity to
    excel. Multiple modes of delivery are acceptable as long as they
    can be shown to lead to equivalent outcomes.
 3. Discrimination. Assessment must be shown to discriminate clearly
    between those learners who gained the specified {{ fmf.skills }} and
    those that did not. This may be through a pass/fail outcome in
    which all learners who pass the unit can demonstrate the
    {{ fmf.skill }}; or it could be through some threshold, such that
    learners might pass the assessment but not achieve a grade high
    enough to guarantee that they can demonstrate the IoC {{ fmf.skills }}.

# Version Information

This is version [{{ version.major }}.{{ version.minor }}.{{ version.postfix }}] of the {{ fmf.fmf_long }}
specification.

## Version Numbering

  This is a version-controlled document.  The latest version can be
  accessed at {{ fmf.doc_url }}.  Courses created using the
  {{ fmf.fmf_long }} should clearly state the version of this document
  that was used to prevent confusion.  

  It is recommended that courses update to the latest version of this
  document as soon as possible. The IoC will make every effort to keep
  the time between versions as long as possible.

  Versions identifiers are of the format [major.minor.postfix]. Major
  and minor are integers such that a higher relative major version
  always indicates a newer version and a higher relative minor version
  between documents with equal major versions indicates a newer
  version.  Versions with equal major number will generally be
  similar, with larger minor version indicating clarifications and
  fixing of errors.  Changes to the major version number indicate more
  fundamental changes to the intention of parts of the document or the
  {{ fmf.fmf_long }} as a whole.

  The postfix element will always be one of *final* or *draft*. Any
  version with a postfix of *draft* is for consultation and
  information only. Only when a version is released with a postfix
  element of *final* should it be considered for use.
